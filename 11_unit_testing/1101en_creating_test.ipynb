    "### Testing Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is a process through which the software system is checked to verify whether it meets requirements and operates without errors. There are two main testing methods: `manual` and `automated`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manual Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "`Manual testing` is a testing method where a tester performs tests without the help of specialized tools. Manual testing can be useful for the initial assessment of software functionality, but it is time-consuming and may lead to human errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "`Automated testing` is a testing method where tests are performed using specialized programs and scripts. In Python, there are several libraries for automated testing, such as unittest, pytest, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unittest Library\n",
    "\n",
    "`Unittest` is a standard Python library designed for automated testing. It provides various methods to write tests and check results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assert Methods\n",
    "\n",
